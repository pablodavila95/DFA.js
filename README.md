# DFA.js
This is a website in HTML + Vanilla JS that enables you to analyze a string with a DFA.

If you want to analyze a string with a given automata this is the tool you should use. 
Usage: add the number of states (Q) you need, and an alphabet of characters (max. 4).
Select where each state/characters leads you to, checkbox means it is an accepting state and radio determines where the automata begins.

Comments are in spanish but it is relatively easy to understand.
